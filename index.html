                    You're trying to get your team to guess the phrase on the card through various methods.
                    For each attempt, you have 30 seconds to try to get your team to guess the answer using the restrictions
                    required for the attempt. If your team is unable to guess the answer after all 3 rounds,
                    the other team has one shot to steal and get 3 points.
                    <br>Attempt 1 - 3pts - Act it out
                    <br>Attempt 2 - 2pts - Draw it out
